## 👉 Project Setup

We build this custom script to make your project setup easier. It will create a new Hugo theme folder, and clone the Hugoplate theme into it. Then move the exampleSite folder into the root directory. So that you can start your Hugo server without going into the exampleSite folder. Use the following command to setup your project.

```bash
npm run project-setup
```

### 👉 Install Dependencies

Install all the dependencies using the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

### 👉 Development Command

Start the development server using the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```
